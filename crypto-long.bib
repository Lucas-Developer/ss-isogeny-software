@article{montgomery,
    abstract = {Since 1974, several algorithms have been developed that attempt to factor a large number \$N\$ by doing extensive computations modulo \$N\$ and occasionally taking {GCDs} with \$N\$. These began with Pollard's \$p - 1\$ and Monte Carlo methods. More recently, Williams published a \$p + 1\$ method, and Lenstra discovered an elliptic curve method ({ECM}). We present ways to speed all of these. One improvement uses two tables during the second phases of \$p \pm 1\$ and {ECM}, looking for a match. Polynomial preconditioning lets us search a fixed table of size \$n\$ with \$n/2 + o(n)\$ multiplications. A parametrization of elliptic curves lets Step 1 of {ECM} compute the \$x\$-coordinate of \${nP}\$ from that of \$P\$ in about \$9.3 \log\_2 n\$ multiplications for arbitrary \$P\$.},

    abstract = {{The claw finding problem has been studied in terms of query complexity as one
of the problems closely connected to cryptography. For given two functions, f
and g, as an oracle which have domains of size N and M (N<=M), respectively,
and the same range, the goal of the problem is to find x and y such that
f(x)=g(y). This paper describes an optimal algorithm using quantum walk that
solves this problem. Our algorithm can be generalized to find a claw of k
functions for any constant integer k>1, where the domains of the functions may
have different size.}},

@inproceedings{zhang,
    abstract = {{This paper gives a quantum algorithm to search in an set S for a k -tuple satisfying some predefined relation, with the promise that some components of a desired k -tuple are in some subsets of S . In particular when k =2, we show a tight bound of the quantum query complexity for the Claw Finding problem, improving previous upper and lower bounds by Buhrman, Durr, Heiligman, Hoyer, Magniez, Santha and de Wolf [7]. We also consider the distributed scenario, where two parties each holds an n -element set, and they want to decide whether the two sets share a common element. We show a family of protocols s . t . q ( P ) 3/2 . c ( P )= O ( n 2 log n ), where q ( P ) and c ( P ) are the number of quantum queries and the number of communication qubits that the protocol P makes, respectively. This implies that we can pay more for quantum queries to save on quantum communication, and vice versa. To our knowledge, it is the first result about the tradeoff between the two resources.}},
